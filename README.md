# Canvas Quiz Review

### By Matthew Bulger

A simple Chrome (or Edge) extension that hides the results of an already-taken Canvas Quiz so that you can review the quiz without immediately seeing what you answered on your previous attempt.

## Installation
1. Download the "CanvasQuizReview" folder
2. Go to "extensions" in Chrome or Edge
3. Select "Install Unpacked Extension"
4. Select the "CanvasQuizReview" folder (ensure "manifest.json" is at the root of the folder).

## Usage
1. Go to a quiz in Canvas that has already been taken.
2. Select the extension in the top-right corner, and click "Activate".
3. Any styles that would give away which answer you previously selected will disappear until you select "Deactivate" in the menu, or you refresh the page.
